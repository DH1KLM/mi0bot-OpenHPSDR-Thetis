- [change] exporting a tx profile will now ask for destination location and filename. It will complain if filename already exists
- [change] restored step attenuator RX1 if HERMES is used. Unsure why I disabled it a few years ago
- [change] the bespoke TCI command tx_frequency has changed back to the following as per the TCI protocol, tx_frequency:3700000; . There is now a bespoke Thetis message also sent out at the same time, tx_frequency_thetis:3700000,b80m,false,false;
- [change] refactor serial port pin change detection code for slight performance improvements

	- releasing the dial will return to the tunestep that was set when the dial pad was pressed
	- option in settings to always show both vfoa+b so you don't need two of them for rx1+2
	- tune step up (red ring) will happen at rotation speed >= 540deg per second, and step down (blue ring) at <= 270deg per second
	- mouse wheel can be used
- [add] tci swl spot support. Implemented to handle swl spots from OE3IDE's Cluster-TCI-Bridge software. If using the TCI spot message, the mode field can have -swl[X] added to the mode, example 'ssb-swl[10]', and that spot would then last 10 seconds before being cleared away
- [add] The outbound tci message tx_frequency has been modified and will include some extra information over the standard protocol. This has been added to support the way Thetis deals with vfoTX and RX2. Note, this is not in the standard TCI protocol The message is as follows, and args 2,3,4 are additional to the base TCI message.
	- tx_frequency:3700000,b80m,false,false;
