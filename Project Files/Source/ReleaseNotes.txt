# !! CW Warning !!

If you use CW and you have different RX and TX antenna ports configured, there is a high potential for full RF power to be present briefly on the RX port. This may lead to damage of any sensitive equipment attached to the RX port such as active antennas and the like. This situation can occur if you utilise the CWX form, serial keying/PTT, and standard hardware keys plugged into the radio. This issue is currently under investigation and has existed in Thetis for an extended period (years and years). If you are interested in following the progress, you can read more about it on [GitHub here](https://github.com/ramdor/Thetis/issues/228).
